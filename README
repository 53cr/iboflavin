Migrating?
  try 
  `mv vendor/plugins/thinking_sphinx .; rake db:migrate; mv think* vendor/plugins`
  
Making an account?
  Likely private beta mode is turned on - this forces users to have a valid invitation url to sign up. We don't want any snoopers.
  
  To make a new valid account you will need to:
    * Enter your email on the main page invite box
    * Log onto server and script/console
    * i = Invitation.find_by_recipient_email('your@email.com')
    # Then visit http://#{the domain}/register/#{i.token}
